# Raspberry Pi Temperature API
An ASP.Net Web API to read and produce data from the Raspberry Pi Temperature Sensor Project <a href="https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/Raspberry_Pi_Temperature">Found Here</a>

This is an API for both the storage and retrieval of items. 

For now the functionality is:

- Store a temperature reading
- Retrieve the latest temperature
- Retrieve a set, ordered by DESC or ASC
